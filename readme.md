# Bullhorn Resume Generator

A Code Louisville project created by Evan Markert as a creative way to foster conversations around work and the work/life experiences that go into crafting design/development projects. The app accepts a name and email field as info to be displayed on the 'resume' and generates work experiences from an object of jobs held by folks currently working at Bullhorn.
