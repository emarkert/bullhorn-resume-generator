# Bullhorn Resume Generator

A Code Louisville project created by Evan Markert as a creative way to foster conversations around work and the work/life experiences that go into crafting design/development projects. The app accepts a name and email field as info to be displayed on the 'resume' and generates work experiences from an object of jobs held by folks currently working at Bullhorn. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Project Requirements

* Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app (../data/jobs.json/)
* Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format 
* Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program (../data/jobs.json/ is a self-maintained JSON file)
* Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event) (Resume will use today's date and render on resume component)
